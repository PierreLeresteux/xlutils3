\title{A function that extracts all xls[x] files in a folder}
\usage{
extract_excel(folder, general_case = NULL, weird_cases = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{folder}{Path to folder}

\item{general_case}{Args to be passed to `readxl::read_excel` for all sheets of all workbooks. Defaults to NULL.}

\item{weird_cases}{Args to be passed to `readxl::read_excel` for specific sheets. Overwrites general_case. Defaults to NULL. See `Details`.}
}
\value{
data A list of workbooks, each is a list of sheets as dataframes
}
\description{
Store all data in one list of lists (ie one list of workbooks, each
workbook is a list of sheets, each sheet is a dataframe (or an error message if applicable))
}
\details{
`general_case` is one flat list of args (lines to skip and the like) to be passed to `readxl::read_excel` for all sheets.
    `weird_cases` is a nested list of such args for known specific cases.
    It is recommended you try to read the data without these argument at first, and then make adjustments according to outputs.
    The nested structure of `weird_cases` is `wb` (basename of Excel file) then `sheet` (name of a sheet) then args. See `Examples`.
    You may specify neither or one or both. If you specify both, `general_cases` is used and `weird_cases` overwrites it only where applicable.
